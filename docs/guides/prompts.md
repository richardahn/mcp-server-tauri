# Using Prompts (Slash Commands)

Prompts are pre-built templates that guide your AI assistant through multi-step workflows. In MCP clients like Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code, these appear as **slash commands** you can invoke directly.

## What Are Prompts?

While **tools** are individual actions the AI can take (like taking a screenshot or clicking a button), **prompts** are complete workflows that combine multiple tools into a guided experience.

| Aspect | Tools | Prompts |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Control** | AI-controlled | User-controlled |
| **Scope** | Single action | Multi-step workflow |
| **Invocation** | AI decides when to use | You type a slash command |
| **Example** | `tauri_webview_screenshot` | `/fix-webview-errors` |

## Available Prompts

### /fix-webview-errors

**Purpose:** Find and fix JavaScript errors in your Tauri app's webview.

**When to use:**
- Your app is showing unexpected behavior
- You see errors in the browser console
- Something isn't working and you're not sure why

**What it does:**

```
1. Connects to your running Tauri app
2. Retrieves console logs and errors from the webview
3. Analyzes error messages and stack traces
4. Identifies the type of error (TypeError, ReferenceError, etc.)
5. Locates the problematic source code
6. Proposes concrete fixes
7. Cleans up the session
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Your Tauri app must be running
- The MCP bridge plugin must be installed
- `withGlobalTauri` must be enabled in `tauri.conf.json`

**Example session:**

```
You: /fix-webview-errors

AI: I'll help you find and fix JavaScript errors in your Tauri app.

    Starting automation session... ✓ Connected on port 9223

    Found 2 errors:

    1. TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
       at UserList.vue:42

    2. ReferenceError: fetchUsers is not defined

## How to Use Prompts

### In Windsurf

Type the slash command directly in the Cascade chat:

```
/fix-webview-errors
```

### In Claude Desktop

Type the command in the chat input:

```
/fix-webview-errors
```

### In VS Code / Cursor

Use the command in the Copilot or AI chat panel:

```
/fix-webview-errors
```

::: tip Prompt Discovery
Most MCP clients will show available prompts when you type `/`. Look for prompts from the "tauri" server.

## When to Use Prompts vs. Direct Requests

### Use a Prompt When:

- You want a **guided, structured workflow**
- You're debugging and want **comprehensive analysis**
- You want the AI to follow **best practices** automatically
- You're not sure which tools to use

### Use Direct Requests When:

- You need a **quick, one-off action** ("take a screenshot")
- You want **specific control** over what happens
- You're doing something the prompts don't cover
- You want to **combine tools** in a custom way

## Troubleshooting

### Prompt Not Found

If your AI assistant doesn't recognize the slash command:

1. **Verify the MCP server is loaded** - Ask "What Tauri tools are available?"
2. **Restart your AI assistant** - MCP servers are loaded at startup
3. **Check your configuration** - Ensure the tauri MCP server is configured correctly

### Session Connection Failed

If the prompt can't connect to your app:

1. **Is your app running?** - Start it with `tauri dev`
2. **Is the MCP bridge plugin installed?** - Check your `Cargo.toml`
3. **Is `withGlobalTauri` enabled?** - Check your `tauri.conf.json`
4. **Is port 9223 available?** - The bridge uses this port by default

### No Errors Found

If the prompt reports no errors but something is wrong:

1. **Reproduce the issue** - Trigger the error while the session is active
2. **Check the browser console manually** - Some errors may not be captured
3. **Try a direct request** - Ask the AI to "get console logs" directly

## Creating Custom Workflows

While built-in prompts cover common scenarios, you can always ask your AI to perform similar workflows manually:

> "Connect to my Tauri app, check for console errors, and help me debug any issues you find"

This gives you the same result with more flexibility to customize the process.
